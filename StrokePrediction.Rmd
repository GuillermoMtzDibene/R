# The Stroke Prediction Challenge

In this presentation I am going to study a data set from the data analysis challenges website: Kaggle.

This data set can be found here [Stroke](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

The idea is to predict if a given patient will have a stroke given a series of features of the patient.


# Description of the features

Feature				| Description
--------			|------------
`gender`			| A categorical variable with three levels: "Male", "Female" and "Other"
`age`				| A continuous variable indicating the age of the patient
`hypertention` 		| A dummy variable indicating if the patient has hypertension
`heart_disease`		| A dummy variable indicating if the patient has heart disease
`ever_married` 		| A dummy variable indicating if the patient has ever been married
`work_type` 		| A categorical variable with 5 levels: "children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private" and "Self-employed"
`residence_type` 	| A categorical variable with two levels: "Urban" and "Rural"
`avg_glucose_level` | A continuous variable indicating the average glucose level in the blood
`bmi`				| A continuous variable indicating the body mass index of the patient
`smoking_status`	| A categorical variable with 4 levels: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" and "Unknown" (which means unavailable)


Respose				| Description
--------			|------------
`stroke`			| A dummy variable with indicating if the patient had a stroke or not


### Literature review.

The first thing to do, is to read what is already known about strokes. For example, I found the following information in the PHSA website (in this [link](http://www.phsa.ca/health-info/stroke)). The main risk factors for a stroke (both modifiable and non-modifiable) that appear in the features are: smoking, unhealthy weight (the feature `bmi` has weight in it), sex, medical history (both `hypertension` and `heart_disease` fall here).


# The set up

Now, I will load some libraries. I will mainly use base `R` together with the following libraries:

Library | What for?
--------|-----------
`tidyverse` | Data cleaning, munging and preprocessing; this is a whole ecosystem of libraries
`lvplot` | To plot violin plots with `ggplot2`
`MASS` | Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analyses
`caret` | KNN
`bestglm` | Feature selection of `glm` models
`randomForest` | Random Forests
`gbm` | Boosting models
`e1071` | Many models but I use na√Øve Bayes from this library
`ROCR` | ROC curves

Before loading the data, I quickly opened it in my spreadsheet viewer and it looks quite fine. I should have no problem loading it.

```{r Loading Libraries, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lvplot)
library(MASS)
library(caret)
library(bestglm)
library(randomForest)
library(gbm)
library(e1071)
library(ROCR)
```
```{r Loadin data}
data <- read_csv(
	r"(stroke_data.csv)",
	na = c("", "NA", "N/A")
)
```

### Some quick info of the data:

There are
```{r}
nrow(data)
```
observations

From the categorical data `gender`, we have
```{r}
data %>% count(gender)
```
Unfortunately, there is only one observation for "Other" in `gender` which means we either have to process it or delete it from the data set.

```{r}
data %>% count(smoking_status)
```
This is quite bad since 30% of the observation is missing this important feature. We may need to consider every model with and without this variable.

```{r}
data %>% count(age)
```
It seems that before age 2, babies are counted in a fraction of a year, probably the use months (1/12 = 0.833...) and round them to 0.08, this causes the jump from 1.88 to 2.0. We are going to alter this into 0 and 1. 0 will be the babies who are not 1 year old and 1 will be those between 1 and 2 years old.


We now check this data set for missing values.
```{r}
map(data, ~ sum(is.na(.)))
```
We see that only `bmi` has missing values. The variable `id` is not useful for us, so we will drop it.


Let us finally see if the response variable is evenly distributed
```{r}
data %>% count(stroke)
```
This is a data set where the response variable is rare, so we are probably more interested in the precision and sensitivity of the model as opposed to its accuracy.




# Some preprocessing

With this information, we can see that there are a few things we need to do.

1. I will drop the observation where `gender == "Other"`. Unfortunately, a single observation is not useful for data analysis.

2. The `bmi` is missing a few data points. Later, I will randomly split the data into training and test set; I will fill the missing `bmi` values with the _mean of the training set_.

3. Age needs some preprocessing too: those age less than two are given in fraction of a year and this is different from the rest of the data, we are going to make the spacing even by considering any observation between 0 and 1 to be 0 and between 1 and 2 to be 1.

4. The features `gender`, `ever_married`, `work_type`, `Residence_type` and  `smoking_status` are considered characters. We have to transform them into unordered factors (this is the default of the `as_factor()` function).

5. I will do some feature engineering and consider "children" as "Never_worked".

```{r Preprocessing}
data <- data %>%
	dplyr::select(gender:stroke) %>%
	filter(gender != "Other") %>%
	mutate(
		work_type = if_else(work_type == "children", "Never_worked", work_type), #If you take care of your children, we will consider you self-employed
		age = if_else(0 < age & age < 1, 0, age),
		age = if_else(1 <= age & age < 2, 1, age),
		ever_married = if_else(ever_married == "Yes", 1, 0),
		Residence_type = if_else(Residence_type == "Urban", 1, 0),
		
	) %>%
	mutate(
		gender = as_factor(gender),
		work_type = as_factor(work_type),
		smoking_status = as_factor(smoking_status),
		stroke = as_factor(stroke)
	)
```

And a last peak at the data.
```{r}
tail(data)
```
Now everything looks to be of the right type of data.

### Train and test split
```{r Train test split}
set.seed(12)
train <- sample(1:nrow(data), size = 4100) #4100/5109 is roughly 80% of the data
data_train <- data[train, ]
data_test  <- data[-train, ]
```

### Imputing missing values

Although this is not the best strategy, we will impute all the missing values in `bmi` with the mean of the training data. There is roughly only 3% of missing values.

```{r Imputing missing values}
bmi_mean = round(mean(data_train$bmi, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)

data_train <- data_train %>% replace_na(list(bmi = bmi_mean))
data_test  <- data_test %>% replace_na(list(bmi = bmi_mean))
```





# Some visualisations

I will use the library `ggplot2`. I will also code a `multiplot` function o display multiple plots together.

```{r Multiplot Function}
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL, title = "") {
	library(grid)
	
	# Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist
	plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)
	
	numPlots = length(plots)
	
	# If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
	if (is.null(layout)) {
		# Make the panel
		# ncol: Number of columns of plots
		# nrow: Number of rows needed, calculated from # of cols
		layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
						 ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
	}
	
	if (numPlots==1) {
		print(plots[[1]])
		
	} else if (title == "") {
		# Set up the page
		grid.newpage()
		pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))
		
		# Make each plot, in the correct location
		for (i in 1:numPlots) {
			# Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
			matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))
			
			print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
											layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
		}
	} else {
		# Set up the page
		grid.newpage()
		#We add one row for the title
		pushViewport(
			viewport(
				layout = grid.layout(
					nrow(layout) + 1,
					ncol(layout),
					heights = c(1, rep_len(10, ncol(layout)))
				)
			)
		)
		grid.text(label = title, vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = 1, layout.pos.col = 1:ncol(layout)))
		
		# Make each plot, in the correct location
		for (i in 1:numPlots) {
			# Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
			matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))
			
			print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row + 1,
											layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
		}
	}
}
```

# Age, Gender, Heart disease, Hypertension and Strokes

```{r Definition of plots}
plot_gender <- data_train %>% ggplot(aes(gender, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Gender",
		y = "Proportion",
		fill = "Stroke?"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)
	

plot_age_gender <- data_train %>% ggplot(aes(age, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_histogram(bins = 15) +
	facet_wrap(~ gender) +
	labs(
		x = "Age",
		y = "Number of individuals"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_hyper <- data_train %>% mutate(hypertension = as_factor(if_else(hypertension == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(hypertension, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Hypertension",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_heart <- data_train %>% mutate(heart_disease = as_factor(if_else(heart_disease == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(heart_disease, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Heart disease",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)
```

```{r Showing plots, out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
multiplot(plot_gender, plot_hyper, plot_age_gender, plot_heart,
	cols = 2,
	title = "Some visualisations"
)
```

__Note:__ somewhat surprisingly, `gender` does not affect stroke for this data set. That is,
$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathrm{Stroke} = \mathrm{Yes} | \mathrm{Gender} = \mathrm{Male}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathrm{Stroke} = \mathrm{Yes} | \mathrm{Gender} = \mathrm{Female})
$$
and same for $\mathrm{Stroke} = \mathrm{No}$.

# BMI, Glucose and Strokes

```{r BMI Glucose plots}
plot_bmi_boxplot <- data_train %>% mutate(stroke = as_factor(if_else(stroke == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(stroke, bmi)) +
	geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.15) +
	labs(
		x = "Stroke",
		y = "Body Mass Index"
	)

plot_bmi_histogram <- data_train %>% mutate(stroke = as_factor(if_else(stroke == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(bmi, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
	labs(
		x = "Body Mass Index",
		y = "Count"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_glucose_violin <- data_train %>% mutate(stroke = as_factor(if_else(stroke == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(stroke, avg_glucose_level)) +
	geom_violin() +
	geom_boxplot(width = 0.05, outlier.alpha = 0.05) +
	labs(
		x = "Stroke",
		y = "Avg. glucose level"
	)

plot_glucose_histogram <- data_train %>% mutate(stroke = as_factor(if_else(stroke == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(avg_glucose_level, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
	labs(
		x = "Avg. glucose level",
		y = "Count"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)
```

```{r Showing Plots 2, out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
multiplot(
	plot_bmi_boxplot, plot_bmi_histogram, plot_glucose_violin, plot_glucose_histogram,
	cols = 2,
	title = "Stroke and two continuous variables"
)
```

We see that `bmi` does not seem to influence strokes, again, somewhat surprisingly.

# Other categorical variables

```{r Categorical plots}
plot_smoking <- data_train %>% ggplot(aes(smoking_status, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Smoking status",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_x_discrete(
		labels = c("Before", "Never", "Currently", "Unknown")
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_work <- data_train %>% ggplot(aes(work_type, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Working type",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_x_discrete(
		labels = c("Priv.", "Self Emp.", "Gov.", "Never")
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_residence <- data_train %>% mutate(Residence = as_factor(if_else(Residence_type == 1, "Urban", "Rural"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(Residence, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Residence type",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)

plot_married <- data_train %>% mutate(ever_married = as_factor(if_else(ever_married == 1, "Yes", "No"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(ever_married, fill = stroke)) +
	geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	labs(
		x = "Have you ever been married?",
		y = "Proportion"
	) +
	theme(
		legend.position = "none"
	) +
	scale_fill_manual(
		values = c("lightblue", "darkred")
	)
```

```{r Showing Plots 3, out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
multiplot(
	plot_smoking, plot_married, plot_residence, plot_work,
	cols = 2,
	title = "Other variables and stroke"
)
```


Interestingly, it would seem that "Never worked" prevents strokes. "People should stop working altogether!" On a serious note, we can check the ages of those who have never worked

```{r}
data_train %>% count(age, work_type) %>% filter(work_type == "Never_worked")
```

All of them, babies, kids and teenagers. This is bad since one variable is a full predictor of another (age and work-type).




# Conclusions from the plots

The previous plots suggest the following preliminary conclusions.


Variable 				| Related to strokes?
:-------:				|:------------------:
Gender					|No
Age						|Yes, seems strong
Hypertension			|Yes, seems strong
Heart Disease			|Yes, seems strong
Body Mass Index			|No
Avg. Glucose level		|Yes, seems weak
Smoking					|Inconsistent plot
Residence type			|No
Work type				|No
Ever Married			|Yes, seems strong

__We will continue to work only with those features that seem related to stroke and smoking.__

```{r Selection of variables}
data_train <- data_train %>%
	dplyr::select(age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, smoking_status, ever_married, stroke)
data_test <- data_test %>%
	dplyr::select(age, hypertension, heart_disease, avg_glucose_level, smoking_status, ever_married, stroke)
```


# First models

The most basic models to consider, that requires no parameter adjusting, are:

* Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* Logistic Regression

We are going to fit all these classifiers using the selected variables above. Furthermore, we use the function `bestglm` from the package of the same name to perform an exhaustive search for the best feature selection in logistic regression. One caveat, `bestglm` is a bit tricky to use. Instead of accepting a formula, it requires a  `data.frame` of the form Xy, where X is a design matrix and y is the response vector, but X should not have an intercept added for `bestglm` adds it itself.  However, since we have categorical variables, creating a model matrix from `R` base functions will always create a column representing the intercept or will always use one of the categorical variables and add all the levels.

### Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

We finally create a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, which also requires no parameter adjusting.

```{r Model Naive Bayes}
model_naive <- naiveBayes(
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train
)
```


### Linear discriminant analysis

This model assumes that the distribution of the features, given the response, follows a Guassian distribution, whose matrix of covariances is not a function of the response. This results in a linear boundary between the responses.

```{r Model LDA}
model_lda <- lda(
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train
)
```


### Quadratic discriminant analysis

Similar to linear discriminant analysis except that now the different classes are allowed to have their own matrix of covariances. This results in a quadratic boundary.

```{r Model QDA}
model_qda <- qda(
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train
)
```


# Logistic regression

As mentioned earlier, we now do a full exhaustive search. Since there are 2 continuous features, 3 binary and 1 categorical with 4 levels, the following code will actually test all $2^8 = 256$ models for us.

```{r Best GLM, message = FALSE}
X_train <- model.matrix(
	stroke ~ 0 + age + hypertension + heart_disease + avg_glucose_level + ever_married + smoking_status,
	data = data_train
)
X_train <- X_train[, 1:(ncol(X_train)-1)] #We discard the column corresponding to Unknown smoking and this is absorbed by the intercept which is automatically added by bestglm

#Use as.data.frame here since tibbles coerce each column as a list while a data frame will keep the vectors
Xy_train <- as.data.frame(cbind(X_train, data_train[, "stroke"]))
model_logis_BIC <- bestglm(
	Xy_train, #Data has to be of the form [design_matrix, reponse_vector]
	family = binomial, #Logistic regression
	IC = "BIC" #We use Schwarz' bayesian information
)

model_logis_AIC <- bestglm(
	Xy_train, #Data has to be of the form [design_matrix, reponse_vector]
	family = binomial, #Logistic regression
	IC = "AIC" #We use Akaike's information
)
```

We know for sure that the best model, according to Schwarz' bayesian information is:
```{r message = FALSE}
model_logis_BIC$BestModel

model_logis_BIC_best <- glm(stroke ~ age + avg_glucose_level, data = data_train, family = binomial)
```

And for Akaike's information:
```{r message = FALSE}
model_logis_AIC$BestModel

model_logis_AIC_best <- glm(stroke ~ age + hypertension + avg_glucose_level + smoking_status, data = data_train, family = binomial)
```

Both models seem to be really quite good and they both differ very little in their residual deviance and their Akaike's information are almost the same. We will keep both to test later on. Something that seems really good about AIC over BIC is that AIC seemed to choose the "right" (most intuitive) variables such as `smoking_status = "smokes"` as opposed to "Unknown".

We will also compare with a full model
```{r Full Logistic}
model_logis_full <- glm(
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train,
	family = binomial
)
summary(model_logis_full)
```

We see how the deviance is just a bit smaller than a much smaller model, suggesting that indeed the full model has too many predictors.

# Other classification models

Having done logistic regression as our basic classification, we proceed with other models.

### Additive model

We are going to construct an additive model using boosting consisting solely of stump. We are going to select a very small learning rate (0.001) and select the optimal number of trees using cross-validation.

```{r Boosting CV, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(19)
k <- 10 #Number of folds
folds <- sample(
	1:k,
	size = nrow(data_train),
	replace = TRUE
) #data_train[folds == i, ] is the testing set for the ith fold

num_trees <- c(100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000) #Different number of trees

cv_boost <- matrix(
	data = NA, #No data
	nrow = k,
	ncol = length(num_trees),
	dimnames = list(paste(1:k), num_trees)
) #An empty matrix to put the error cv_boost[i, m] is the ith fold error for the mth number of trees

data_train_aux <- data_train %>%
	mutate(
		stroke = as.double(stroke)-1
	) #gbm function does not accept factors as response

#Ditto for the test set
data_test_aux <- data_test %>%
	mutate(
		stroke = as.double(stroke)-1
	)


#Now the cross-validation
for (i in 1:k) {
	for (m in seq_along(num_trees)) {
		temp_model <- gbm(
			stroke ~ ., #We use all variables
			distribution = "bernoulli", #Binary classification
			data = data_train_aux[folds != i, ], #Train on everything but the testing set
			n.trees = num_trees[[m]],
			shrinkage = 0.001
		)
		temp_prob <- predict(
			temp_model,
			newdata = data_train_aux[folds == i, ],
			type = "response"
		) #This predicts the probability of having stroke
		temp_pred <- if_else(temp_prob > 0.5, 1, 0) #We use 0.5 cutoff
		cv_boost[i, m] <- mean( temp_pred == data_train_aux$stroke[folds == i] ) #We use the accuracy in the CV
	}
}

cv_boost_means <- apply(cv_boost, 2, mean)
cv_boost_means
```

We see that the estimated accuracy was the same regardless the number of trees. We are going to keep the middle value.

```{r Boost Error Graphs, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
cv_boost_means <- as_tibble(cv_boost_means) %>%
	mutate(
		n_trees = num_trees
	)

cv_boost_means %>% ggplot(aes(n_trees, value)) +
	geom_point(size = 1.25) +
	geom_line() +
	labs(
		title = "Cross-validation of accuracy",
		colours = "Lear. rate",
		x = "Number of trees",
		y = "Estimated accuracy"
	)
```


```{r Model boost, fig.align = 'center'}
model_boost <- gbm(
	stroke ~ .,
	distribution = "bernoulli",
	data = data_train_aux,
	shrinkage = 0.001,
	n.trees = 500
)

summary(model_boost, cBars = 2)
```

In this model (which is linear), all the influence lies on the feature `age`. This seems to be bad and a poor choice. Later, we will test all models using the testing set.

# K-Nearest Neighbours

This algorithm __only works with numeric variables__ and is __sensitive to scale__.

```{r CV KNN}
model_knn <- train(
	method = "knn",
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train,
	preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
	trControl = trainControl(
		method = "cv",
		number = 10,
	),
	tuneGrid = data.frame(
		.k = 1:9
	),
	metric = "Kappa"
)

model_knn
```

```{r , out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
plot(model_knn)
```

We see that $\kappa$ was maximised when there was a single neighbour (this makes sense since the vast majority did not have a stroke).

```{r Training of KNN}
std_scaler <- function(x) {
	( (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) )
}

data_train_knn <- dummyVars(
	~ ., #Expand everything
	data = data_train %>% dplyr::select(-stroke), #Do not use the response
	sep = "_"
)
data_train_knn <- predict(
	data_train_knn,
	newdata = data_train %>% dplyr::select(-stroke)
) #This actually creates the data frame
data_train_knn <- apply(data_train_knn, 2, std_scaler)


###Ditto for the test data
data_test_knn <- dummyVars(
	~ ., #Expand everything
	data = data_test %>% dplyr::select(-stroke), #Do not use the response
	sep = "_"
)
data_test_knn <- predict(
	data_test_knn,
	newdata = data_test %>% dplyr::select(-stroke)
)
data_test_knn <- apply(data_test_knn, 2, std_scaler)

model_knn <- knn3(
	x = data_train_knn,
	y = data_train$stroke,
	prob = TRUE,
	k = 1
)
```





# Random forest

We now will try to fit a random forest. There are two parameters that we need to select. The number of trees in the forest and the number of features each tree is allowed to select.

```{r Random Forest CV}
#We use the same k and folds from before
num_trees <- c(750, 1000, 1500, 2000)
num_featu <- c(5,6)

cv_ranForst <- array(NA, dim = c(k, length(num_trees), length(num_featu)), dimnames = list(paste(1:k), num_trees, num_featu))

for (i in 1:k) {
	for (m in seq_along(num_trees)) {
		for (f in seq_along(num_featu)) {
			temp_model <- randomForest(
				stroke ~ .,
				data = data_train[folds != i, ],
				ntree = num_trees[[m]],
				mtry = num_featu[[f]]
			)
			temp_pred <- predict(temp_model, newdata = data_train[folds == i, ])
			temp_pos_class <- sum(data_train$stroke[folds == i] == 1) #Count how many had stroke in this fold
			cv_ranForst[i, m, f] <- sum( (temp_pred == 1) & (data_train$stroke[folds == i] == 1) ) / temp_pos_class
		}
	}
}

cv_ranForst_means <- apply(cv_ranForst, c(2,3), mean)
```

We now plot the estimated accuracy

```{r Random Forest Error Graphs, out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
cv_ranForst_means <- as_tibble(cv_ranForst_means) %>%
	mutate(
		n_trees = num_trees
	) %>%
	pivot_longer(
		cols = as.character(num_featu),
		names_to = "num_feat",
		values_to = "est_acc"
	)

cv_ranForst_means %>% ggplot(aes(n_trees, est_acc, colour = num_feat)) +
	geom_point(size = 1.25) +
	geom_line() +
	labs(
		title = "10-fold CV estimated sensitivity for Random Forest",
		x = "Number of trees in the forest",
		y = "Estimated sensitivity",
		colour = "N. features"
	) +
	scale_x_continuous(breaks = num_trees)
```

We then create a random forest classifier using 5 features and 750 trees

```{r Model Random Forest}
model_ranForst <- randomForest(
	stroke ~ .,
	data = data_train,
	ntree = 750,
	mtry = 5,
	importance = TRUE
)
```

```{r out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
varImpPlot(
	model_ranForst,
	type = 1,
	class = 1,
	main = "Importance plot for random forest"
)
```


# Testing the models.

We have trained several models, from very simple (Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression) to more complex (Random Forest Classifier). We now compare them using the test data and creating a __ROC__ curve and report its __AUC__.

```

```

plot_auroc(roc_knn, main = "KNN(K = 1)")
```


# Conclusions

Any of the basic classifiers: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analyses seem to perform about the same. Any of these models can then be passed to a professional of the field who may choose, based on what they may consider a good trade-off between the FPR and TPR.

Another option would to create an __ensemble classifier.__ Having set a trade-off between FPR and TPR, we can set the cut-off probabilities for the best models here and obtain their responses and finally take a majority vote for prediction.

Another possibility is to include interaction terms between age and the variables found. For example, Logistic Regression as selected by BIC has the features age and average level of glucose in the blood. These two features are also related and an interaction term may then be sound.

# After thougths

Let us do the Logistic Regression with an interaction between age and glucose level.

```{r out.width = '90%', fig.align = 'center'}
model_logis_inter <- glm(
	stroke ~ age + avg_glucose_level + age : avg_glucose_level,
	data = data_train,
	family = binomial
)
pred_prob_logis_inter <- predict(
	model_logis_inter,
	newdata = data_test,
	type = "response"
)
roc_logis_inter <- roc_curve(
	pred_prob_logis_full,
	data_test$stroke
)
plot_auroc(roc_logis_inter, main = "Interactions")
```

We see that interaction terms do not improve over the model selected by Schwarz' bayesian information criterion.
