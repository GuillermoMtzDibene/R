# R
I will upload some data visualisation or analyses I have done with R, as well as some modellings.

<a href = "https://guillermomtzdibene.github.io/R/Gapminder_visualisation.html">Gapminder </a> In this visualisation I plot both the life expectancy as well as the child birth rate for several countries and the world, and see the trend.

<a href = "https://guillermomtzdibene.github.io/R/ISL_Chapter4_exercises.html">ISL, Chapter 4</a> In this visualisation I worked through exercises 10 and 11 of Introduction to Statistical Learning. In Exercise 11, using KNN with (k = 3) and two variables, I produced a model with 88% accuracy, vs a 50% that random guessing would give.
